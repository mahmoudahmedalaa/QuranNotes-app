# v1.0.1 Battery Fix - Deployment Guide

## Status
✅ **Ready to deploy** - Code is tested and pushed to GitHub  
📍 **Branch**: `fix/battery-optimization`  
🔗 **GitHub**: https://github.com/mahmoudahmedalaa/QuranNotes-app/tree/fix/battery-optimization

---

## What This Fixes

**Battery Drain Issue**: App was draining 28% battery in 20 minutes during audio playback

**Root Causes Fixed**:
1. ❌ Indeterminate progress bar (infinite GPU animation)
2. ❌ Status updates firing 60 times/second (constant React re-renders)
3. ❌ Moti animation re-running on every render
4. ❌ No actual progress tracking

**After Fix**: Expected battery drain ~5-8% per 20 minutes (normal for audio)
